# Q.8: Predict the output of the following code:

if True and False:
    print('Yes!')
else:
    print('No...')

# My prediction is that the result with be 'No...' in this case, and evaluates both True and False, and since the last
# value evaluated is falsy, then the statement executes the else statement which returns No...
