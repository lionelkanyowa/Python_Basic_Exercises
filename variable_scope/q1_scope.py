# Q.1: What will the following code do and why? Don't run it until you have tried to answer.

if True:
    my_value = 20

print(my_value)

# This would output 20. Variables initializes inside a block (like inside an if statement) are accessible outside of
# that block.
# The my_value initialized inside the if block on line 4 can be accessed and printed ob line 4.
