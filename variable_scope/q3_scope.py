# Q.3: What will the following code do and why? Don't run it until you have tried to answer.

def my_function():
    a = 1

    if True:
        print(a)


my_function()

# This would print 1 since the variable is being initialized is within the function where the if statement block is.
# The 'a' variable can be accessed within the if statement block, which is why the print(a) statement  on line 7 outputs
# 1 when my_function is invoked.
