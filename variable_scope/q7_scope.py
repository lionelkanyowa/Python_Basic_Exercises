# Q.7: What will the following code do and why? Don't run it until you have tried to answer.

a = 1

def my_function():
    global a
    a = 2

my_function()
print(a)

# In this code, the global keyword tells the function to assume that 'a' refers to the global variable 'a'. This means
# that any operation on the variable 'a' inside this function will affect the global variable 'a', not a local one.

# Initially, the global a is assigned the value 1. When my_function is called, it reassigns the global a to 2.
# So, after the function call, the value of the global a has been changed to 2. Thus, when we call print(a) after
# invoking my_function, it prints 2.
