# Q.7: Predict the output of the code shown below. When you run the code, do you see what you expected? Why or why not?

list1 = [2, 6, 4]
list2 = [2, 6, 4]

print(list1 == list2)

# My prediction: The output word be True. This is because the equality operator compares the values of each object
# variable. And since each object contains the same values, then the output would be returned as True.
